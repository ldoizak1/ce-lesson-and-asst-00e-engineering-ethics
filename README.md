_Your study and submission work here..._
1. 1.2.2 Ethics in a what a group of people determins what is morally right about a certian subject that a group of people come to aggrement appon based on what they view as good and bad. Some ethics that i was suprised to see because i did not know they exsited are Feminist ethics, Aficran ethics, Descrate ethics. 
2. 1.2.3 Aristotle put the responsibility of ethical behavior on the person he belives that the person is resbonsible for thier own behavior. he belives that every person that make virtuous acts require conscious choice and moral purpose or motivation. This means that a person would be fully aware of what they are doing.
3. 2.2.2 If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society the justic system would not be need anymore because then everyone would never be putting anyone else in danger by making descisions that could potentially harm someone else. This is the case because you have to consider ever descision you make and how it can effect other groups of people.
4. 2.2.3 Quarintine is actually a descision that is made between comfort and longevity based on making everyon stay at home you get to make thier longevity grow while comfort is put aside. To embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code you would have to look at what each individual person in a group to figure out what the collective sees s important to them. you can see this with the LGBT community with having diffrent pro nouns that they perfer.
5. 3.2.1 Inequalities this artical talks a lot about is the fact of after a disatster people are dealing and coping with what just happend with thier lifes in shammbles. There are resercher that have not expiernced this trama that just come invade to get info and over look some aspects because they are more focused on getting info which can be annoying to the people that are dealing with the event first hand who are just longing for thier life to return to normal and all the reserch care about is getting info. They want to build an ethical code for disater relif so that the prirmary focus is on the people and getting them better befroe anything else is focused on. 
6. 3.2.2 Quarentine is a big topic that has come for corona virus it they is debate if this is even helping sences we still have essiential bussiness open and if it is just damaging the economy more than it is helping us beat this epidemic. this then branches off in to more topics. Like if we should do a full shutdown, or if we should just re-open. it has also caused issues with unemploment for many people that is its not finacally possible for bussiness to keep thier employees imployed while not being open this has been a topic if the goverment should pay the bussiness to help people still get paid or just pay people which the goverment chose to pay the people. Which is also making another propblem for rent which is causing another topic of disscussion if landlords should not make people pay thier rent. Some have decied not to charge rent some have decied to charge it just another battle with ethics for thoes landlords. 
7. 4.2.1 This has built on to my ethics understanding of computer sciences where we have to be carful with what we do because we are gaing knowledge of what is basically becoming everyone life most everthing is online know days and we are gain the knowledge of how to use that.
8. 4.2.2 it cover being friednly paticent and understanding of having disargements. which this is targeted towards the user.the biggest element is understanding that this is for all and people are all diffrent so to have and open mind while using OSS. we have been using microsoft teams.
9. 4.2.3 main ethical aspect they take about is ethically good solutions to relitive problems that are being created. We might have information on something but we have to decied if it is ethically good for the community as a whole because everyone can acess the data bank we are creating.
10. 4.2.4 a technical conference need its very own Code of Conduct to insurece that everyone is respected and herard sences people will have free rain to talk whenever or make rude comments while someone it talking.
11. 4.2.5 Googlel is concerned with saftey, weapons, privacey vilotion, interfiering with human rights. They are talking about user and builder taking responsiblities for what they are using and making sure to use it apprioatily and not amking it so it causes harm to other people.
12. 4.2.6 Ethics and hacking can go together because hacking can be used to help improve someones firefall by figuring out where weak points are so you can make them not weak points. this is done by trying to hack in to a system this is how they can see what they lack you are basically building to protect the system form you and people with the same knowledge as you have.
13. 5.2.1 rouge behavior leads to prisoners dilemea by making people question if they can trust each other to uphold the ethic code. Ways to insentisive people to uphold the ethic code would be creating a reward system that gives people a wanting to uphold the ethic code.  A reward could be like 100$ if a person is exciding the expectaions of the ethic code then they will want to uphold the ethic code.
14. 5.2.2
