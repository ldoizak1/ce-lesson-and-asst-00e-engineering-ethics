_Your study and submission work here..._
1. 1.2.2Ethics in a what a group of people determins what is morally right about a certian subject that a group of people come to aggrement appon based on what they view as good and bad. Some ethics that i was suprised to see because i did not know they exsited are Feminist ethics, Aficran ethics, Descrate ethics. 
1.2.3Aristotle put the responsibility of ethical behavior on the person he belives that the person is resbonsible for thier own behavior. he belives that every person that make virtuous acts require conscious choice and moral purpose or motivation. This means that a person would be fully aware of what they are doing.
2. 2.2.2If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society the justic system would not be need anymore because then everyone would never be putting anyone else in danger by making descisions that could potentially harm someone else. This is the case because you have to consider ever descision you make and how it can effect other groups of people.
2.2.3Quarintine is actually a descision that is made between comfort and longevity based on making everyon stay at home you get to make thier longevity grow while comfort is put aside. To embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code you would have to look at what each individual person in a group to figure out what the collective sees s important to them. you can see this with the LGBT community with having diffrent pro nouns that they perfer.
3. 3.2.1Inequalities this artical talks a lot about is the fact of after a disatster people are dealing and coping with what just happend with thier lifes in shammbles. There are resercher that have not expiernced this trama that just come invade to get info and over look some aspects because they are more focused on getting info which can be annoying to the people that are dealing with the event first hand who are just longing for thier life to return to normal and all the reserch care about is getting info. They want to build an ethical code for disater relif so that the prirmary focus is on the people and getting them better befroe anything else is focused on. 
3.2.2Quarentine is a big topic that has come for corona virus it they is debate if this is even helping sences we still have essiential bussiness open and if it is just damaging the economy more than it is helping us beat this epidemic. this then branches off in to more topics. Like if we should do a full shutdown, or if we should just re-open. it has also caused issues with unemploment for many people that is its not finacally possible for bussiness to keep thier employees imployed while not being open this has been a topic if the goverment should pay the bussiness to help people still get paid or just pay people which the goverment chose to pay the people. Which is also making another propblem for rent which is causing another topic of disscussion if landlords should not make people pay thier rent. Some have decied not to charge rent some have decied to charge it just another battle with ethics for thoes landlords.
